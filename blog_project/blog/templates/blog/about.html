  <h3 class="text-light">🚀 What’s Next?</h3>
  <p>This is just the beginning! I’m planning to add features like:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>🎨 <strong>User choice of themes</strong> — pick the style that suits you best</li>
    <li>👤 <strong>User bios</strong> — personalize your profile with a short description</li>
    <li>📩 <strong>Email subscriptions</strong> — keep readers updated with your latest posts</li>
    <li>🔎 <strong>Search bar</strong> — filter content easily and find exactly what you want</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    These features are on the way to make <span class="text-success">your blogging experience smoother, more fun, and more personal</span>.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    So, go ahead — start posting, start reading, start connecting.
